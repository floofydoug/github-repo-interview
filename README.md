# GitHub Repositories Viewer Coding Interview

Welcome to the coding interview for our startup! In this task, you'll build a simple React application that fetches and displays a list of GitHub repositories for a given user. This exercise will help us assess your practical skills in React, API integration, error handling, and overall frontend development.

## Objective

Your goal is to create a small web application that:
- Allows the user to enter a GitHub username.
- Fetches the list of public repositories for that user using the GitHub API. Endpoint: https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos
- Displays the list of repositories with relevant details such as the repository name, description, number of stars, and a link to the repository on GitHub.


## Requirements

1. **Input Field:** Create an input field where the user can enter a GitHub username. 
2. **Fetch Data:** Use the GitHub API to fetch repositories for the entered username.
3. **Display Repositories:** Display the list of repositories with the following details:
   - Repository Name
   - Description
   - Number of Stars
   - Link to the Repository
4. **Loading State:** Show a loading indicator while fetching data.

### Bonus Features (Optional)

If you have extra time, consider adding the following features:
- **Sorting:** Allow sorting by stars, name, or creation date.
- **Pagination:** Handle users with a large number of repositories by implementing pagination.
- Handles loading states and errors gracefully.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
### 2. npm install
